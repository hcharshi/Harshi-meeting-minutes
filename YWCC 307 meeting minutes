Agenda item:
Research Btc, Robinhood
Presenter:
Harshi

Discussion:
Robinhood has been making significant strides in the cryptocurrency space, especially with Bitcoin. They've introduced features like crypto wallets and expanded the range of digital currencies available for trading. Recently, they acquired Bitstamp, a move designed to enhance their global presence in the crypto market. However, they face ongoing regulatory challenges that could influence their growth and strategic direction. We also discussed how we are going to do our presentation.
Conclusions:
Robinhood is positioning itself as a major player in cryptocurrency trading. To maintain momentum, theyâ€™ll need to navigate the regulatory landscape carefully while continuing to innovate and adapt to the evolving market.

Agenda item:
Understanding Ethereum 
Presenter:
Daniel Lobo

Discussion:Understanding Ethereum Platform 

Conclusions:
Understand Ethereum as a platform and for other crypto platforms such as Solana and Bitcoin. The main idea is that at first we thought platforms were exchanges such as Robinhood and Coinbase. This is not correct. We will still have to introduce them while we present as the normal person will not be able to crypto currency. Other ways of buying crypto currencies would be mining or peer to peer transactions. Which is when you buy crypto for a fiat currency. There are websites for this.
